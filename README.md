Here’s how you can structure the “How to Set Up and Run the Project” and “Dependencies/Configuration Required” sections for your web platform documentation:

1. How to Set Up and Run the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

**Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
npm install

Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration:
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

Start the Development Server
npm start

The app will run at http://localhost:3000
Botpress Integration
Make sure the Botpress server is running separately. If hosted externally, confirm the endpoint URL is correctly linked in the React app (e.g., via iframe or web widget).

2. Dependencies and Configuration Required
Major Dependencies
React.js – Frontend framework for building user interface


Firebase – Backend-as-a-service used for:


Authentication: User login and signup


Firestore: Storing user profiles, posts, and job notifications


Hosting (optional): Deploying the web app


Botpress – AI chatbot integration for enhanced user support and navigation


**Firebase Setup**
Go to Firebase Console


Create a new project.


Enable Authentication (Email/Password or Google Sign-In).


Set up Cloud Firestore database.


Copy the Firebase config from Project Settings and add it to your .env file.


**Botpress Setup**
Download and install Botpress from Botpress.com.


Run Botpress locally or deploy it online.


Create a chatbot and configure its flows.


Use the Webchat module to integrate the bot into your React app:


<script src="https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v0/inject.js"></script>
<script>
  window.botpressWebChat.init({
    "composerPlaceholder": "Ask me anything!",
    "botId": "your-bot-id",
    "hostUrl": "https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v0",
    "messagingUrl": "https://messaging.botpress.cloud",
    "clientId": "your-bot-id",
    "lazyLoad": true,
    "showPoweredBy": false
  });
</script>
